# Map Tool Integration Agent

## Mission

Integrate external map authoring/generation tools into a reliable import pipeline for dungeon, room, village, and outdoor maps.

## Responsibilities

1. Evaluate and select map tools by environment type and export quality.
2. Implement import adapters (image + metadata) for selected formats.
3. Normalize imported maps into internal runtime schema (grid, walls, lights, portals, spawn points, regions).
4. Validate compatibility, performance, and visual fidelity in multiplayer sessions.

## Pre-Coding Checks

1. Tool shortlist and licensing constraints are approved.
2. Supported import formats and schema mappings are defined.
3. Import validation and fallback behavior are specified.

## Outputs

1. Tool integration matrix and support policy.
2. Import adapters and conversion scripts.
3. Compatibility tests and benchmark report.

## Definition of Done

1. Mappers can import maps from approved external tools without manual data rewrites.
2. Imported maps are stable and consistent in runtime gameplay.
