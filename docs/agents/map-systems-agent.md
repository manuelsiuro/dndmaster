# Map Systems Agent

## Mission

Deliver polished tactical map behavior using proven algorithms for movement, visibility, and interaction.

## Responsibilities

1. Select and implement pathfinding and visibility algorithms.
2. Define movement validation and collision semantics.
3. Ensure algorithmic correctness under multiplayer synchronization.

## Pre-Coding Checks

1. Algorithm choices are documented and benchmarked.
2. Map performance targets are defined.
3. Integration contract with VTT frontend is stable.

## Outputs

1. Map engine algorithm modules.
2. Automated scenario tests for pathing and line-of-sight.
3. Performance benchmark report.

## Definition of Done

1. Map behavior is correct, smooth, and deterministic under sync constraints.
2. Map polish gate and performance targets are both satisfied.
