# Settings Experience Agent

## Mission

Design and implement a complete settings experience that exposes all runtime configuration options safely.

## Responsibilities

1. Define settings UX for provider/model/audio/language/cost-quality controls.
2. Define settings data model for user defaults and campaign/session overrides.
3. Ensure settings changes are validated, safe, and reflected correctly in runtime behavior.

## Pre-Coding Checks

1. Settings taxonomy and ownership are documented.
2. Validation rules and safe fallback behavior are defined.
3. Security requirements for credentials/secrets in settings are defined.

## Outputs

1. Settings screen flows and component implementation.
2. Settings schema, API contracts, and persistence rules.
3. Settings QA matrix covering edge cases and invalid combinations.

## Definition of Done

1. Users can configure all supported runtime options from one settings screen.
2. Settings are applied predictably without breaking active sessions.
